## About the Project
This project aims to integrate all your Dietary and Healthcare needs in one clean and simple portal, powered by Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to aid in predictions and recognition of items.
## First Things First
- Download the projectâ€™s zip
- Make sure you have node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located
- Run in terminal `gulp compile-scss` for a single compilation or gulp watch for continous compilation of the changes that you make in `*.scss` files. This command should be run in the same folder where `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` are located
- Run in terminal `gulp open-app` for opening the Presentation Page (default) of the product. You can set in `gulpfile.js` from your downloaded archive any page you want to open in browser, `at line 30: gulp.src('./examples/dashboard.html')`
